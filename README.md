# GalaxyShooter

Project created from the 2D section from "The Definitive Guide to Game Development with Unity" (https://www.udemy.com/course/o-guia-definitivo-para-desenvolvimento-de-jogos-com-unity/)
instructed by Mr. Jonathan Weinberger and Unity Technologies organization. Please note that the finished project/code may differ from the end result of Mr. Weinberger's project due to
experimentation/creativity that I thought would be more interesting to implement.
